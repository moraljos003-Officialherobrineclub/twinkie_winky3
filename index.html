      <h1>Welcome to my Official Christian Minecraft server!</h1>
        After that, you can put some normal text here.
          <p>“[Christ in Our Place] For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” -Romans 5:6-8 Copyright © 1982 by Thomas Nelson, Inc. Powered by BibleGateway.com

2. No Griefing.
- This includes over breeding, unleashing snow-golem's, chickens, or anything otherwise destructive to the server.

3. No Hacks, Mods, or X-rays Allowed!
- This is a legit build server, cheating will not be tolerated! 
- When banned for breaking this rule or similar (griefing etc.), we report to MCBans and MCBouncer.

4. Non-PvP Server.
- Unless it's agreed upon by both players beforehand, you should never strike another player.

6. Absolutely No Resource Gathering in Survival or UHC Worlds.
- To gather resources, please go to the Resource Worlds, where you can mine freely. (In the survival and UHC worlds, the portals are located at spawn.)

7. Respect Your Neighbors Space.
- When claiming land out in the open, never build within 100 blocks of a marked plot or territory. If you desire to build close to someone, communicate with the owner(s) about a respectful distance from them before you commence building. 
- However, players building beside spawn, a main road/rail system, (adding to the community) will only need to stay a safe 10 blocks in distance from neighbors.
- Do not build below another players property. If they claimed land, assume from sky to bedrock is theirs as well.

8. No Buying And Selling Land.
- All territories belong to the server. Land should never be sold, it is free to be claimed in a reasonable fashion.

Game Etiquette
Claim Your Buildings With IGN - If you have a claimed area, make sure you add noticeable signs stating your In Game Name.
No Trespassing - Unless you have express permission, don't explore other peoples' builds - wait until they're in-game and ask for a tour.
Don't Neglect Your Pet - We suggest you leave pets at home when logging off. We're not responsible for any pet deaths left in public places.
