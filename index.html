          <p>“[Christ in Our Place] For when we were still without strength, in due time Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.” -Romans 5:6-8 Copyright © 1982 by Thomas Nelson, Inc. Powered by BibleGateway.com
